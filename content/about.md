[Reswitched Weekly](https://reswitched.github.io/blog/) was a blog covering the Nintendo Switch hacking scene as it developed from the point of view of the ReSwitched discord. It died out because the news slowed down. This attempted revival of ReSwitched Weekly continues the spirit of the original while expanding outside just the switch.  The ReSwitched Weekly reboot will consist of 2 formats - roundups, which will highlight the happenings in the community in the past week, and in-depth blog posts discussing a specific topic or event by an RS member. We're hoping to get lots of our great community members involved, showing off the cool things they have been working on. Let's start strong with a roundup of the 8th week of 2023!
